# Simple-Web-Page
This project is a simple webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML defines the structure with headings, paragraphs, an image, and a hyperlink. CSS styles the page with colors, fonts, spacing, and hover effects for a clean layout. JavaScript adds interactivity by triggering an alert message when the button is clicked.
